CrowClicker written by Jacob Whiteis

Use the randomizer feature to make clicks undetectable
to all anti auto-clicker software I've tested it on.
The randomizer is more advanced than simply random delays
in between clicks. It should be essentially indistinguishable
from a human clicking.

Designed for use with Java 11
